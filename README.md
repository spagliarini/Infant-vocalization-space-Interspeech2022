## Pre-processing
1. Extraction of single vocalizations using MATLAB routine. 
2. Extraction of MFCCs coefficients, velocity and acceleration using OpenSMILE. 
3. Compute the low-dimensional representation (UMPA, t-SNE, PCA): python code.
4. Compute statistical properties of the clusters across families and across time (age): python and R codes.
